Level Goal
Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!


Bandit Level 26 → Level 27 Explanation

After successfully escaping the restricted shell,
a normal interactive shell is now available.
This allows standard Linux commands to be executed
without limitations.

The main objective of this level is to quickly locate
the password for bandit27.
The password is stored in a protected file
within the system.

With full shell access, file permissions and locations
can be explored freely.
Using basic file navigation and viewing commands,
the required file can be accessed.

Once the correct file is identified,
its contents reveal the password for bandit27.
No additional exploitation or automation
is required for this level.

This level reinforces the importance of
proper shell access in system administration.
It also demonstrates how restricted environments,
once bypassed, expose standard system resources.
