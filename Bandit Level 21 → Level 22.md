Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. 
Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

Bandit Level 21 → Level 22 Explanation

In this level, the password for the next level is not stored
in a regular file inside the home directory.
Instead, the system uses a scheduled task to handle the password.

A cron job is configured to run automatically at regular intervals.
This cron job executes a script using the privileges of bandit22.
The script reads the password and writes it to a temporary location.

To solve this level, it is important to understand how cron jobs work
and where their configuration files are stored.
The cron configuration directory reveals which script is being executed.

By analyzing the script, it becomes clear where the output is written.
The output file contains the password generated by the cron job.
Since the file permissions allow reading, the password can be accessed.

This level teaches the importance of reviewing scheduled tasks
and understanding how automated scripts may expose sensitive data.
It also highlights how misconfigured cron jobs can lead
to privilege escalation in real-world systems.
